# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I'm working on SkillSync, a Python-based CLI app for managing workshop bookings and one-on-one meetings.<br>👯 I'm open to collaborating on any project that allows me to learn and grow as a developer. Whether it's API development, web applications, game design, or something entirely new, I'm excited to contribute and exchange knowledge with like-minded individuals. If you have an idea or project in mind, feel free to reach out—I'm always down to explore something new!<br>🤝 As a newcomer to coding, I’m eager to learn and improve in all areas of development. Whether it’s understanding best practices, debugging, optimizing code, or tackling challenging concepts, I’m always open to guidance and support. If you have tips, resources, or advice to share, I’d greatly appreciate it!<br>🌱 I’m currently focused on learning Python and aim to master it before diving into other programming languages or technologies. My goal is to build a strong foundation in Python, as I believe it’s a versatile and powerful language that will help me tackle a wide range of projects and challenges.<br>💬 Feel free to ask me about my journey into coding, my current projects, or the lessons I’ve learned along the way. I’m also happy to share my experiences with learning Python and tackling my first major solo project. Let’s connect and exchange ideas!<br>
